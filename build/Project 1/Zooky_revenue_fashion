Project Requirements
Real-Time Processing:

Collect revenue data from multiple sources (website, mobile app, partners).
Process data instantly for fast reporting.
Scalability:

The system should handle data growth and increasing users in the future.
System Integration:

Connect with storage systems (Hadoop, Elasticsearch) and analytics tools (Tableau, Power BI).
High Reliability:

Ensure data integrity and stable processing.
Components in the Architecture
Producers:

Applications that send revenue data to Kafka topics.
Example: API from the Zooky Mobile app sends transaction details.
Kafka Cluster:

Hosts topics to store revenue data.
Uses replication for high availability.
Consumers:
