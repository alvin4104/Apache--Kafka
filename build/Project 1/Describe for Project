Project: Zooky Sports Store Management System
Project Overview
Zooky Sports is a chain of retail stores selling sports products across multiple cities in the United States. With a large volume of transactions daily, managing real-time data is crucial to ensure operational efficiency and optimize business performance. Apache Kafka serves as the core technology in this system, enabling real-time data collection, processing, and analysis from all stores.

System Details Using Apache Kafka
1. Kafka System Architecture
The system is designed with three main components:

Producers: Sources that send transaction data from each store to Kafka.
Topics: Intermediate channels in Kafka where data is temporarily stored before being processed.
Consumers: Components that process and consume data from Topics, such as storing it in a database or providing it to analytics tools.
2. Data Design
Transaction data is transmitted in JSON format with the following fields:

transaction_id: Unique transaction identifier.
store_id: Identifier of the store where the transaction occurred.
product_id: Identifier of the sold product.
product_name: Name of the product.
quantity_sold: Number of products sold.
price_per_unit: Price per unit of the product.
total_revenue: Total revenue from the transaction (quantity_sold * price_per_unit).
timestamp: Time of the transaction.
Sample Data:

json
Copy code
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN12345",
  "store_id": "STORE001",
  "product_id": "PRD56789",
  "product_name": "Soccer Ball",
  "quantity_sold": 3,
  "price_per_unit": 25.00,
  "total_revenue": 75.00,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-28T14:25:00Z"
}
3. Kafka Data Processing Workflow
Data from Producers:

Each store sends transaction data in real-time to the Kafka Topic zooky_revenue.
Data is sent in JSON format.
Kafka Topic:

Topic Name: zooky_revenue
Partitioning: Data is partitioned by store_id to ensure load balancing.
Replication Factor: 3, to guarantee high availability.
Consumers:

Consumer 1: Saves the data to a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for reporting purposes.
Consumer 2: Performs real-time data analysis, such as identifying best-selling products.
Consumer 3: Generates automatic alerts if sales drop unexpectedly or inventory is low.
4. Real-Time Inventory Management
Data from Kafka Consumers integrates with the inventory management system to:
Automatically deduct inventory for each transaction.
Alert for restocking when inventory levels fall below a defined threshold.
5. Reporting and Analytics
Daily Reports: Aggregates revenue and product sales by store.
Real-Time Analysis: Uses tools like Tableau or Power BI to provide insights on sales trends and product performance.


6. Integration with Other Systems
Payment System Integration
Kafka connects with the payment gateway for seamless processing.
Transaction Status: Kafka records whether a transaction is successful, failed, or pending.
Topic: zooky_payments.
Example JSON data:
json
Copy code
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN12345",
  "payment_status": "SUCCESS",
  "payment_method": "CREDIT_CARD",
  "amount": 75.00,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-28T14:26:00Z"
}
Customer Feedback
After every purchase, customers provide feedback, which is ingested into Kafka.
Feedback Topic: zooky_feedback.
Example JSON:
json
Copy code
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN12345",
  "customer_id": "CUST9876",
  "feedback": "The soccer ball was of great quality!",
  "rating": 5,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-28T15:00:00Z"
}
Consumer Actions:
Store feedback in a database for performance reviews.
Trigger alerts for low ratings or recurring complaints.
7. Monitoring and Scaling
Kafka Monitoring
Tools Used:

Kafka Manager: Monitors partitions, replication, and topic health.
Prometheus + Grafana: Provides dashboards for metrics like throughput, lag, and errors.
Key Metrics:

Producer Throughput: How much data producers are sending per second.
Consumer Lag: Delays in processing messages from Topics.
Partition Distribution: Ensures data is evenly distributed across partitions.
Scaling Strategy
Producers:
Scale by adding new producers for high-traffic stores.
Kafka Brokers:
Increase broker count when Topics exceed current capacity.
Consumers:
Scale consumers horizontally by creating consumer groups for heavy workloads like analytics.
8. Security
Authentication & Authorization
SASL/SSL: Encrypts communication between Producers, Kafka Brokers, and Consumers.
Access Control Lists (ACLs):
Producers can only write to specific Topics.
Consumers can only read from authorized Topics.
Data Backup
Kafka topics use a replication factor of 3 for high availability.
Periodic backups are created using Apache Flink or a custom backup service.
9. Advanced Use Cases
Dynamic Pricing
Kafka analyzes real-time sales trends and triggers price updates:
E.g., Increase prices for best-sellers during peak demand.
Topic: zooky_pricing.
Fraud Detection
Kafka streams detect suspicious activities like:
Multiple transactions in short intervals from the same store.
Inconsistent pricing or inventory levels.
Alerts sent to the zooky_alerts Topic for investigation.
Predictive Analytics
Consumer integration with machine learning models to predict:
Future best-sellers.
Inventory requirements for the next quarter.
10. Benefits of Using Kafka
Real-Time Data Flow:
Enables instant processing of transactions and inventory updates.
Scalability:
Handles high transaction volumes across multiple stores.
Decoupled Architecture:
Producers and Consumers operate independently, ensuring fault tolerance.
Flexibility:
Multiple Consumers for analytics, inventory, and reporting from the same Topic.
